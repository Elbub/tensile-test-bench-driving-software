# tensile test bench driving software
 Some Python code driving a test bench made for rope testing.

This code is still very much a work in progress. Much of it is rough, messy even.

I'm working on an older Python script (SoftC10TL27_old.py) driving a workbench. My job is to improve 
it using CRAPPy (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711021001278), fastening its 
acquisition rate, and to add some functionnalities.

To change what will appear in the .csv and .xlsx files, search "le csv (et le xlsx)". There's 
comments indicating the parameters of the test and the columns to get.
