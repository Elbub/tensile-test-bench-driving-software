# tensile test bench driving software
 Some Python code driving a test bench made for rope testing.

This code is still very much a work in progress. Much of it is rough, messy even.

I'm working on an older Python script (SoftC10TL27_old.py) driving a workbench. My job is to improve 
it using CRAPPy (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711021001278), fastening its 
acquisition rate, and to add some functionnalities.
